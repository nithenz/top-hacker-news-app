# Installation guide
This is basic react-native-cli setup, which I used to develop on macos environment and running on ios simulator and on my own iPhone.`

`yarn install`
`yarn start` and then
`yarn ios`

or https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#running-your-react-native-application (set ios target mode)

And don't forget to run `cd ios && pod isntall` if you are dealing with some issues with starting the app

And `yarn lint` to be sure that there is no warnings and errors !
